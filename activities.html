                    <h3>Team building Motivational Activities</h3>
                    <p>In addition to providing an academic environment, 
                        the Digital Business Academy also considers the interests and 
                        enjoyment of its students. Outside of the parameters we establish 
                        for them in the classroom, every student in the DBA deserves 
                        the highest quality of environment. Through events like the Town 
                        Hall Meeting/Mixer, Academy, Olympics, Wacky Day/Awards, and End 
                        of Year Academy (Academic) Awards, our kids get to experience the 
                        rewards of their hard work.</p>

                    <h3>Face-to-Face Career Mentor Program</h3>
                    <p>Some outstanding mentors with extensive expertise in the job fields 
                        our students aspire to follow beyond college will be introduced to 
                        our students. In order to succeed in today's environment, they 
                        assist pupils in developing practical objectives and abilities. For a 
                        head start in the real world, the DBA offers all of our juniors a mentor match, 
                        monthly mentor meetings, and a mentor end-of-year celebration.</p>

                    <h3>Job Shadow Opportunities</h3>
                    <p>We collaborate with NAF academies each year to offer our high school 
                        students some employment chances so they can be ready for their professional 
                        lives both during and after college. We assist them with all the tools, and 
                        interview preparation such as mock interviews through the City of Milpitas, 
                        resume writing, and other particulars related to securing an internship. 
                        The following firms provide us with internship opportunities: NextFlex, Google, 
                        Facebook, AT&T, Verizon, and Cisco.</p>

                    <h3>Curriculum Enrichment Tours</h3>
                    <p>Students are given the opportunity to go on a variety of field trips each 
                        year that complement the curriculum. DBA provides curriculum enrichment 
                        tours to locations such as Angel Island with an Integrated curriculum unit 
                        on Immigration, San Jose Tech Museum or Computer History Museum, DeYoung 
                        Museum or Oakland Museum, Museum of Modern Art MOMA, Academy of Science Museum, 
                        Computer History Museum, to learn more about a topic particularly important 
                        in the time period.</p>

                    <h3>College Tours</h3>
                    <p>Not only do we encourage students to attend curricular enrichment tours, 
                        but we also provide college tours in the area so that students can choose the 
                        college they want to go to or at least get a sense of what college life entails. 
                        We take our students to CSU East Bay/Ohlone College, UC Santa Cruz, San Francisco 
                        State University, Academy of Art University, Santa Clara University/Foothill 
                        College, and San Jose State University/De Anza College. A college tour to multiple 
                        institutions and colleges complements the college application process and is highly 
                        persuasive when it comes to the college essay that applicants must write to be admitted.</p>
